# The environment configuration file

# The main manifest directory or file where Puppet starts to evaluate code
# This is the default value. Works with just a site.pp file or any other .pp
manifest = manifests/

# The directories added to the module path, looked in first match first used order:
# site - The local site modules, included in this control-repo
# modules - Directory for external modules, populated by r10k based on Puppetfile
# $basemodulepath - As from: puppet config print basemodulepath
modulepath = site:modules:$basemodulepath

# Set the cache timeout for this environment

# Example to always cache catalogs (better perfs in high traffic systems):
# environment_timeout = unlimited

# Note: unlimited caching requires that whenever changes thePuppet code and data
# to serve to clients, the cache is flushed. This is done by Code Manager on PE
# or any workflow that flushes caches at every deployment.
# This can also be done manually running: bin/puppet_flush_environment_cache.sh

# Example to completely disable catalog caching (necessary when developing):
environment_timeout = 0

# The script to run to determine Puppet configuration version
# Here we pass to one in the control repo the Puppet environment (and git branch)
# to get title and essential info of the last git commit
config_version = 'bin/config_script.sh $environment'
